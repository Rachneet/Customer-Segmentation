## Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

#### Introduction
Targeting potential customers is an essential task for companies. 
It helps boost their revenue and tailor their needs to cater to the
right customers. Moreover, it helps them understand why particular
segments of people do not use their services. In this project, 
we will study ways of preprocessing a high dimensional dataset
nd prepare it for analysis with machine learning algorithms.
We will use the power of machine learning to segment customers
from a mail-order campaign, understand their demographics,
and predict potential future customers.

#### Libraries Utilized
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib
5. Plotly
